> ⚠️ The Banned plugin list is maintained in a **separate private repository** accessible only to the D.V.V. V0RTEX queries it automatically at startup — it is never exposed publicly.

---

## Plugin Folder Naming

Every plugin folder follows this exact naming convention:

```
PluginName[version][AuthorGitHubUsername]
```

The folder name is updated by the D.V.V. whenever a new version is accepted.

---

## Plugin Manager

The **V0RTEX Plugin Manager** (`plugin_manager.py`) is a standalone tool that lets you browse, install, update, and uninstall plugins directly — without manually copying files.

**Download:** [plugin_manager.py](plugin_manager.py) *(coming soon)*

## plugin.json — Field Reference (D.V.V. / S.E.A.)

This section documents the fields in each plugin's `plugin.json` that are relevant to V0RTEX at runtime. All fields are written and maintained by the S.E.A. — plugin authors do not set these manually.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `hash_full` | string | SHA-256 of the exact plugin `.py` file as verified by S.E.A. |
| `hash_structural` | string | SHA-256 of the file with all `#` comments and docstrings removed |
| `hash_ast` | string | SHA-256 of the normalized AST (variable/function names stripped) |
| `ast_token_count` | integer | AST node count used for similarity scoring |
| `violation` | object or null | Active S.E.A. enforcement record (Level 1 or 2). `null` if no active violation. |

### violation object format

```json
"violation": {
  "level": 1,
  "reason": "Short description of the violation",
  "fix_deadline": "YYYY-MM-DD"
}
```

- `level` — `1` (Warning, plugin remains loadable) or `2` (Suspension, plugin blocked)
- `reason` — human-readable reason shown to the user in V0RTEX
- `fix_deadline` — ISO date by which the developer must fix the issue. Empty string if not applicable.

Level 3 and 4 violations are not stored here — they result in the plugin being added to the private Banned list (`V0rtex-Banned-Plugins`) and removed from this repository entirely.

When `violation` is `null`, V0RTEX treats the plugin as clean. When it contains a Level 1 object, V0RTEX shows a 🟡 badge in CFG → PLUGINS. Level 2 shows 🟠 and the plugin cannot be enabled.
